## Available options for setting up a working environment:

1.  Run Jupyter Lab on [**Mybinder.org**](https://mybinder.org/) (the easiest and fastest option).

    Use binder badge at the top of this page

1.  Run Jupyter Lab locally.

    If you are on Unix, then execute in terminal:
    ```bash
    cd dpm-coursework

    ./boostrap-venv.sh
    ```
